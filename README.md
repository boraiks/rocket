**This is my rocket project which I haven't yet decided on a name for so...**

##This fully functional model rocket project requires these modules:**
1. ##**Arduino Uno R3 (to be honest doesn't matter which version of Arduino do you use, Nano would be great tho):**
2- ##**MPU6050 (Gyro and Acceleration Sensor)**
3- ##**4x MG996R Servo Motor (High Torque)**

##And that's it. Not really actually, we still need fuel to make the rocket go. I'm pretty sure the best option for propellant is a mixture of KNO3 + Sugar
as known as Rocket Candy (check Wikipedia for amateur rocket engine: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_candy).**
